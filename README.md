# TaoExercises

Lean formalizations of exercises, using a project structure modeled after:
<https://github.com/kirill-kondrashov/yoccos-theorem>.

## Current contents

- `TaoExercises.TaoBook.Chapter2.exercise_2_3`:
  Terence Tao, *Solving mathematical problems: a personal perspective*, Exercise 2.3
  (`x^4 + 131 = 3y^4` has no integer solutions in integers).

- `TaoExercises.TaoBook.Chapter2.exercise_2_6`:
  Problem 2.6 (Shklarsky et al. 1962, p. 14):
  if `k` is odd, then `1^k + 2^k + · · · + n^k` is divisible by `1 + 2 + · · · + n`.

## Toolchain and dependencies

- Lean: `leanprover/lean4:v4.27.0`
- mathlib: `v4.27.0`
- doc-gen4: `v4.27.0`

## Build

```bash
lake build
lake exe check_axioms
```

## Useful Make targets

```bash
make cache      # fetch Mathlib cache
make build      # lake build
make check      # lake exe check_axioms
make auto-build # cache refresh + build + check
make docs       # build API docs
```

## CI workflow (GitHub Actions)

- `.github/workflows/lean_action_ci.yml`
- Pull requests, pushes, and manual runs all execute a single `leanprover/lean-action` build job.
- Docs are not generated/deployed in CI.
- Workflow concurrency is enabled with `cancel-in-progress: true`.
